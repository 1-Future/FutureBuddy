# FutureFlow

**AI-Native Development Process** by #1 Future

FutureFlow is how we build at #1 Future. A repeatable, human-AI collaborative development methodology built around one truth: the best software starts with real frustration, not theoretical use cases.

---

## The Process

### Step 0 - Inspire
Using software you like, you hit a pain point that should not exist. That friction is the seed. Every feature in FutureBuddy started here - not from a roadmap, but from something that was annoying.

### Step 1 - Present
Describe the idea raw. No polish, no pitch deck. Just the thing you want to exist and why.

### Step 2 - Gut Check
AI evaluates the idea - pushes back, asks questions, identifies blind spots. Not to say no, but to sharpen the thinking before investing time in the wrong direction.

### Step 3 - Explore
AI researches the landscape: existing GitHub projects, prior art, tools, what has been tried, what failed, what is the current state of the art. No need to reinvent what already exists. Find the gaps worth filling.

### Step 4 - Pain Point Discovery
Walk through the current workflow of the thing you are building. Surface friction in real time. Pain points discovered through use are real. Pain points assumed upfront are guesses.

### Step 5 - Research
AI deep-dives on revolutionary implementation approaches. Not just how do other tools do this - but what would this look like if it were genuinely great in 2026.

### Step 6 - Plan
Refined master plan incorporating everything from the research. Architecture decisions locked in. Technology choices made. Nothing vague left to figure out during execution.

### Step 7 - Task List to GitHub
Master task list published as a GitHub Issue. Human-readable. Robot-resumable. Progress is visible to anyone - not trapped in a conversation that disappears.

### Step 8 - Execute
Work the task list. The AI picks up context from the GitHub Issue. The human can see exactly where things stand at any point and redirect as needed.

### Step 9 - Test
At meaningful milestones, not constantly. Test where it matters - where quality actually affects the user.

### Step 10 - Iterate
Prompt + test until polished. Repeat from Step 9 until it is right.

### Step 11 - Document
Every feature or product built with FutureFlow gets a user manual. Not an afterthought - a deliberate closing step. The manual explains what was built, how to use it, what commands exist, and what the human needs to know to actually use it. FutureFlow does not end at "it works". It ends at "anyone can use it."

## Why It Works

- **Starts with real pain** - Step 0 ensures everything built traces back to a human frustration, not a hypothetical
- **Research before planning** - you cannot plan something revolutionary without knowing what already exists
- **GitHub as shared memory** - the AI can resume from any point without losing context
- **Human stays in control** - approves plans, directs iteration, decides when it is done
- **No wasted cycles** - intent is clarified before execution begins, not discovered halfway through
- **Documentation is built-in** - Step 11 ensures what is built is actually usable by real humans

## Key Properties

| Property | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Robot-resumable** | GitHub Issues are the memory, not the conversation |
| **Human-readable progress** | Anyone can see exactly where the project stands |
| **Pain-driven** | Every feature traces back to a real frustration |
| **Research-first** | Revolutionary implementations require knowing the landscape |
| **Milestone testing** | Test where quality actually matters, not everywhere |
| **Human-documented** | Every feature ships with a manual written for real users |

## User Manual

### What is FutureFlow?

FutureFlow is a development process designed for humans and AI to build software together. It is not a project management tool, not a ticket system, and not a methodology that requires certification. It is a repeatable sequence of conversations and actions that produces real software from real frustration.

### How to Start a FutureFlow Session

1. Open a conversation with Claude Code (or any FutureBuddy AI interface)
2. Describe the pain point - no formatting required, just explain what is annoying
3. Claude will guide the rest - gut check, research, plan, and task list

The key rule: **do not skip to building before a GitHub Issue exists.** That Issue is the shared memory that allows AI to resume, humans to track, and the project to stay coherent across sessions.

### Human Responsibilities

| Step | Human Does |
|---|---|
| Step 0 - Inspire | Experience the frustration. Notice it. |
| Step 1 - Present | Describe the idea in plain language |
| Step 2 - Gut Check | Read the AI feedback. Push back if something is wrong. |
| Step 3 - Explore | Review the landscape research. Identify what resonates. |
| Step 4 - Pain Point | Use the current tool. Narrate what is frustrating. |
| Step 5 - Research | Read the implementation proposals. Choose a direction. |
| Step 6 - Plan | Approve or revise the plan. Nothing gets built without your sign-off. |
| Step 7 - Task List | Review the GitHub Issue. Confirm it captures what you want. |
| Step 8 - Execute | Stay available for questions. Review progress when needed. |
| Step 9 - Test | Actually use the thing. Report what works and what does not. |
| Step 10 - Iterate | Decide when it is done. |
| Step 11 - Document | Review the user manual. Confirm it matches how you actually use it. |

### AI Responsibilities

| Step | AI Does |
|---|---|
| Step 0 | Nothing yet |
| Step 1 | Listen. Ask clarifying questions. |
| Step 2 | Push back on the idea. Identify gaps and risks. |
| Step 3 | Research GitHub, docs, prior art. Summarize findings. |
| Step 4 | Walk through the workflow. Surface friction points. |
| Step 5 | Research implementation approaches. Propose revolutionary options. |
| Step 6 | Draft the full plan. Get explicit approval before moving on. |
| Step 7 | Create the GitHub Issue with complete task list and checkboxes. |
| Step 8 | Execute tasks. Reference the GitHub Issue for context. Check off tasks as completed. |
| Step 9 | Support testing. Diagnose failures. Suggest fixes. |
| Step 10 | Implement revisions. Re-test. Repeat. |
| Step 11 | Write the user manual. Cover commands, options, and workflows. |

### Gate Rules

These are the moments where the human must explicitly approve before moving forward:

- **After Step 6**: Human approves the plan before any code is written
- **After Step 7**: Human confirms the GitHub Issue before execution begins
- **After Step 10**: Human decides when iteration is complete before Step 11

If you are in a new AI session mid-project, point the AI to the GitHub Issue. That is all the context it needs.

### Handing Off Mid-Project

If your conversation ends and you need to continue in a new session:

1. Find the GitHub Issue for the feature (it was created in Step 7)
2. Start a new conversation and paste the Issue URL
3. The AI will read the Issue, see which checkboxes are complete, and pick up from there

The GitHub Issue is the handoff document. It is designed for this exact situation.

### How FutureFlow Runs in Claude Code

When working with Claude Code inside a FutureBuddy project, FutureFlow runs automatically. Claude will:
- Propose the next step at the right time
- Ask for approval at the gate steps
- Create the GitHub Issue before writing any code
- Write the user manual as the final step

You do not need to memorize the step numbers. Just describe what you want and Claude will guide the process.
