# FutureFlow

**AI-Native Development Process** by #1 Future

FutureFlow is how we build at #1 Future. A repeatable, human-AI collaborative development methodology built around one truth: the best software starts with real frustration, not theoretical use cases.

## The Process

### Step 0 - Inspire
Using software you like, you hit a pain point that should not exist. That friction is the seed. Every feature in FutureBuddy started here - not from a roadmap, but from something that was annoying.

### Step 1 - Present
Describe the idea raw. No polish, no pitch deck. Just the thing you want to exist and why.

### Step 2 - Gut Check
AI evaluates the idea - pushes back, asks questions, identifies blind spots. Not to say no, but to sharpen the thinking before investing time in the wrong direction.

### Step 3 - Explore
AI researches the landscape: existing GitHub projects, prior art, tools, what has been tried, what failed, what is the current state of the art. No need to reinvent what already exists. Find the gaps worth filling.

### Step 4 - Pain Point Discovery
Walk through the current workflow of the thing you are building. Surface friction in real time. Pain points discovered through use are real. Pain points assumed upfront are guesses.

### Step 5 - Research
AI deep-dives on revolutionary implementation approaches. Not just how do other tools do this - but what would this look like if it were genuinely great in 2026.

### Step 6 - Plan
Refined master plan incorporating everything from the research. Architecture decisions locked in. Technology choices made. Nothing vague left to figure out during execution.

### Step 7 - Task List to GitHub
Master task list published as a GitHub Issue. Human-readable. Robot-resumable. Progress is visible to anyone - not trapped in a conversation that disappears.

### Step 8 - Execute
Work the task list. The AI picks up context from the GitHub Issue. The human can see exactly where things stand at any point and redirect as needed.

### Step 9 - Test
At meaningful milestones, not constantly. Test where it matters - where quality actually affects the user.

### Step 10 - Iterate
Prompt + test until polished. Repeat from Step 9 until it is right.

## Why It Works

- **Starts with real pain** - Step 0 ensures everything built traces back to a human frustration, not a hypothetical
- **Research before planning** - you cannot plan something revolutionary without knowing what already exists
- **GitHub as shared memory** - the AI can resume from any point without losing context
- **Human stays in control** - approves plans, directs iteration, decides when it is done
- **No wasted cycles** - intent is clarified before execution begins, not discovered halfway through

## Key Properties

| Property | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Robot-resumable** | GitHub Issues are the memory, not the conversation |
| **Human-readable progress** | Anyone can see exactly where the project stands |
| **Pain-driven** | Every feature traces back to a real frustration |
| **Research-first** | Revolutionary implementations require knowing the landscape |
| **Milestone testing** | Test where quality actually matters, not everywhere |
